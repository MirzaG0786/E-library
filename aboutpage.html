      <h1>About Library</h1>
      <p>
        A library is a collection of books, and possibly other materials and
        media, that is accessible for use by its members and members of allied
        institutions. Libraries provide physical (hard copies) or digital (soft
        copies) materials, and may be a physical location, a virtual space, or
        both. A library's collection normally includes printed materials which
        may be borrowed, and usually also includes a reference section of
        publications which may only be utilized inside the premises. Resources
        such as commercial releases of films, television programmes, other video
        recordings, radio, music and audio recordings may be available in many
        formats. These include DVDs, Blu-rays, CDs, cassettes, or other
        applicable formats such as microform. They may also provide access to
        information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases.

      <h1>History</h1>
      <p>
        The history of libraries began with the first efforts to organize
        collections of documents.[2] The first libraries consisted of archives
        of the earliest form of writing—the clay tablets in cuneiform script
        discovered in Sumer, some dating back to 2600 BC. Private or personal
        libraries made up of written books appeared in classical Greece in the
        5th century BC. In the 6th century, at the very close of the Classical
        period, the great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of
        Constantinople and Alexandria. The Fatimids (r. 909–1171) also possessed
        many great libraries within their domains. The historian Ibn Abi Tayyi’
        describes their palace library, which probably contained the largest
        collection of literature on earth at the time, as a "wonder of the
        world". Throughout history, along with bloody massacres, the destruction
        of libraries has been critical for conquerors who wish to destroy every
        trace of the vanquished community's recorded memory. A prominent example
        of this can be found in the Mongol massacre of the Nizaris at Alamut in
        1256 and the torching of their library, "the fame of which", boasts the
        conqueror Juwayni, "had spread throughout the world".
